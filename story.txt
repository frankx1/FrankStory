Frank was in middle school and woke up late everyday. His mom felt that he was too lazy and needed to make a change. She forced him to go to bed early at night and woke him up every morning at 6. Frank felt this very annoying and started to go against his mom. 

Frank decided the only way to get back at his mom was to sell her prized guinea pigs. He scooped up Harold and Lemmy and ran off to the pet store.
He walked up to the counter and asked how much for the two little cute pets.

But the person at the counter told Frank that they did not accept these random pets from some random person. Frank was upset and he insisted to sell them to the pet store.

When they continued to refuse him, he decides to fool them by giving his guinea pigs fancy haircuts and resell them as exotic pigs from Hawaii to the same store owner. The trick works and the seller finally accept to buy the pigs. When Frank's mom go back home, she finds out that her guinea pigs are all gone. She feels very angry and punshies Frank by taking all his pocket money. Frank is shocked and never ever do that again.
